solitude shadows
In one of the most mysterious and abandoned houses in the area, strange occurrences have caught the attention of the police department. Neighbors have reported hearing screams, gunshots, and seeing suspicious movements around the house. These unsettling reports have led the police to assign a mission to a lieutenant, tasked with investigating the house and verifying the truth behind these eerie complaints. But what awaits inside is a challenge beyond anything the lieutenant could have anticipated.
